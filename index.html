<!-- short introduction of myself -->

	<p id="introduction-paragraph">
		I have always been fascinated with space because of the perspective it gives on what it means to be human. As far as we know, the only planet that life exists is the one we call home, Earth. Because this is our only home, I think it makes sense that we work together to constantly improve ourselves. My interests are in <text class="light-blue">computer science</text> and <text class="light-blue">business development </text> and I hope to use those interests to do something that benefits our civilization rather than degrade it. If you feel the same way, <text class="light-blue"> hit me up!</text>

				A website which I made for my club, Voyager. It uses Backbone.js for its front-end framework, Django as the web framework, and is deployed on Heroku. The python layer helps to process incoming contact requests and in the future, an application portal will be developed for each semester's recruiting.

				Redesigned the Berkeley's DeCal website with Ruby on Rails. On this project, I worked on designing the schema of the database, creating different interfaces for faculty and student, and added logic for how classes should be displayed and interacted with.

				A personal script that I made using Selenium and Python which can play the online game of Mousehunt. This script sounds the horn every 15 minutes and was able to warn the user via email whenever a captcha would come up. I'm currently working on automating that process with scikit-image to resolve the Mousehunt captcha.

				SurveyMonkey was definitely the most enjoyable place to work and learn. I had a great team of engineers to learn from and was able to build an administrative tool to monitor and filter spam emails using Pyramid, Backbone.js, and Bayesian spam filtering. Also, I was able to help incorporate push notificaitons for first response on surveys.

				At Gap, I learned much more than the basics of programming in a professional environment. I really was able to see how a company operating at the scale and size of Gap could function and see what the fashion industry needed in terms of computer science. Here, I was able to work with the Reserve In Store team to create a much more fluid interface.
